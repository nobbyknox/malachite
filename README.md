Project Malachite, named after the beautiful little kingfisher. From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malachite_Kingfisher):

> The Malachite Kingfisher (Alcedo cristata) is a river kingfisher which is widely distributed in Africa south of the Sahara. It is largely resident except for seasonal climate related movements.

Project Malachite is the next incarnation of the recently deceased Project Raven.
