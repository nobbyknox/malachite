# malachite

Project Malachite, named after the beautiful little kingfisher. From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malachite_Kingfisher):

> The Malachite Kingfisher (Alcedo cristata) is a river kingfisher which is widely distributed in Africa south of the Sahara. It is largely resident except for seasonal climate related movements.

Project Malachite is the next incarnation of the recently deceased Project Raven.

Update (2014-04-10): What started as a Ruby on Rails project just died an early death. The project will be converted to use Node.js on the back-end and Ember.js on the front-end.

Update (2015-11-13): Here we go, but with Angular.js instead of Ember.js.
